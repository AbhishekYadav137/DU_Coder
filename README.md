On July 21st,2017 The New York Times have updated an opinion article callled Trump,s Lies detailing every public lie the President has told since taking office. Because this is a newspaper the information was of course published as a block of text. This is a great format for human consumption, but it can't easily be understood by the computer. In this code we will extract the President's lies from the New York Times article and stored them in a structured dataset. Now this is a common scenario, you find a webpage that contains data you want to analyse, but it's not presented in the format that you can easily download and read into your favorite data analysis tool. You might imagine manually copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet but in most cases that is way too time-consuming. A technique called web-scraping is useful way to automate this process so basically web-scraping is a process pof extractinginformation from the webpage by taking advantage of patterns in the webpage's underlying code. The patterns in the following is as follows that is it contains four field:          1: It has a date                                                                                                                           2: It is a quotation given by Trump                                                                                                        3: Writer's brief explanation that why lie is a lie                                                                                        4:It is the URL of the article that substantiates that claim it was a lie
